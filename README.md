Consider a Pizza company which delivers hot pizza of your choice (including choice
of toppings, spices, add-ons, freebees, reward points & their use, etc, etc) to your
home. If pizza is not delivered within 30 minutes of ordering, then it is free and your
company will lose money! Loyal customers will get additional discount too!
